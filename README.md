# Ignition Demo Project & Learning Modules

## Set up your environment. Tips for Windows users:

- Create a new repository on Github. Use .gitignore for python.
- Create a new project in Ignition and open the Ignition project's folder on your PC.
- Open VS Code as Administrator and open the folder. Use git init and git clone to download the repo files.
- Copy the .git folder and readme file up one level. Delete the folder you just downloaded.  
- Create a virtual environment that uses Python 2.7. Ignition does not currently support Python 3.x
-- >> virtualenv --python=C:\Python27\python.exe venv
-- Substitute the path to Python 2.7 with your own
-- >> . venv/scripts/activate
-- >> python -V

You should be all set to run python 2.7 to develop and test your code.
